# Contributing to Dragonfly

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Dragonfly!


## New features and commands

This project is designed to make it easy enough to add new commands and
features. To see what's already implemented, have a look at the
`src/dragonfly/_commands.py` source.

In the future, it might be possible to extend Dragonfly with Python plugins, but
this is not a feature that is currently implemented.


## Open issues and discussions

Another way to contribute is to look at the open issues and see if you can
help. If you find a bug, please report it. If you have a question, please ask
it. If you have a suggestion, please make it.
